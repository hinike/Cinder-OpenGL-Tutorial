# Cinder-OpenGL-Tutorial

[WIP]

Follows the [OpenGl Tutorial](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org) using Cinder's glNext branch.

All tutorials are built using a single Xcode/Visual Studio project, and can be toggled between using Cinder's params interface.

To get things working on your machine, you will likely need to change the CINDER_PATH variable in Xcode.
