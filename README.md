# Cinder-OpenGL-Tutorial

[WIP]

Follows the [OpenGl Tutorial](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org) using [Cinder](https://github.com/cinder/cinder).

All tutorials are built using a single Xcode/Visual Studio project, and can be toggled between using Cinder's params interface. Clone into your blocks directory to build and run.
